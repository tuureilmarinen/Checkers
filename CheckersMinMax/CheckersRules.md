### Simple movement
Pieces MAY move to a unoccupied adjoining square in a direction in which the piece may move to.

### Jumping
Piece MUST capture opponent's piece that is located in an adjoining square in direction in which the piece may move if the next square in that direction is unoccupied.
If the piece can capture an other piece immediately after the previous capture, the piece must do so. If there are multiple options, the player may choose any of them.
If a man reaches the end of the board, the turn ends and the man becomes a king.

The piece that is jumped over is removed from the board.
